# My first project
This is the first project on my way to become a Full-stack Developer. It was a fun project wich i really enjoyed making. I got the grade **Weel Approved** wich is the highest grade.

## Description of the task:
Soon you will be full stack developers and every developer should have their own online resume and portfolio. 
This task is carried out individually and requires you to create your own static one-page page that allows you to list your skills and tell you a little more about yourself. 

# Goal
### The task<br/>
The goal of this task is for you to independently create a page with HTML and CSS where you understand all the parts of the code. 
You may have worked with a CSS preprocessor (not a requirement but increases the chance of VG) and should have optimized and validated all your code. 
In addition, the code you create is accessible, complies with standards and is browser compatible.
You will create a one-page (only one HTML file may be submitted) website to be posted on GitHub Classroom.
